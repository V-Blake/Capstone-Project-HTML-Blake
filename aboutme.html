        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Not much is known before the nice people at the rescue centre found
            me.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a picture of the day I met the people who would become my
            mum & dad.

        />
        <p>They instantly fell in love with me, obviously.</p>
        <p>
            They've been with me for nearly a year now and say they couldn't now
            be without me.
        </p>
        <p>
            We've all learnt some lessons in that time, personally what I can
            and can't chew.
        </p>
        <p>One of my favourite days was my first trip to the beach.</p>

        />
        <p>
            This was then followed by a trip to the pub, always good as dad
            shares his crisps!
